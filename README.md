# Bitfall

My first semester studying Computer Engineering is over. I would love to imagine this small project as a final project. Main reason why I wanted to create this game is to showcase what I have learnt and most importantly solve my problem: memorization of hexadecimals.

By this game, I wish to help anyone who has the same problem.

### Project Overview

Bitfall is a simple educational game that challenges players to convert values between binary and hexadeciaml formats. Player can try to convert values from one another while racing against the clock.

###### Features:
- Binary and Hexadecimal conversion
- Real-time timer to track performance
- Scoreboard to track high scores
- Leaderboard to display top scores

###### Topics and Libraries I implemented:
- OOP , but not in depth.
- Tkinter
- os
- random
- webbrowser
- PIL

###### How to run and install? 

All you need to do is get all the files in the Bitfall folder, then run main.py

###### If there is a problem...

If you run into any issues, feel free to contact me I'd be REAL happy to hear.

Thank you so much.
